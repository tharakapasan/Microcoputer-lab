## Objective 

The main objective of this lab is for you to develop a small water level controlling system of a water tank using the knowledge of interrupts and other programming techniques of PIC16f877a from all the labs we did throughout the course<br>
## Introduction
In this lab we develop a small water level controlling system of a water tank using the knowledge of interrupts and other programming techniques of PIC16F877A. Three sensors which is placed in the water tank as below are used here to check the water level of the water tank. Two DC motors are used are used to pump water in when the water level is low and pump water out when the water level is high. Where motor 1 is used to pump water into the tank and the motor 2 is used to suck water out of the tank. The two motors work according to the three sensors. When the first sensor detects water level, and the others doesnâ€™t the motor 1 activates and starts filling water into the tank and when the water level goes up to the second sensor the motor 1 stays on and keeps the water filling and when third sensor detects the water level the motor 1 turns off and the motor 2 activates and start sucking water out of the tank<br>
